## Overview

This repository contains all necessary files and scripts for constructing profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. Two different approaches were employed: one based on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and the other on 3D structural alignments. Additionally, a visualization of a false positive structure is provided.

## Repository Structure

- **HMM_model_MSA**: This folder contains all input files, output files, and scripts related to building the HMM model based on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).
- **HMM_model_Structures**: This folder contains all input files, output files, and scripts related to building the HMM model based on 3D structural alignments.
- **structural_superimpo_fp.png**: This figure is a Chimera-generated superimposition of the false positive structure.
